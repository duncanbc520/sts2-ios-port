# Slay the Spire 2 - iOS Port & AltStore Sideload Guide

This repository contains the iOS port project and automated GitHub Actions build pipeline for **Slay the Spire 2** (Godot 4.5.2 / .NET 9).

The current port is pinned to the Steam `public-beta` build `24724944`: game version `v0.111.0`, commit `41cef1ea`. Mixing game files from another release is not supported.

## Features & Adaptations in this Port

- **Touch Controls:** Custom touch handling and card drag-and-drop mechanics (`TouchInputPatches.cs`).
- **UI Scaling:** Custom responsive UI scaling for iPhone screens (`UiScalePatches.cs`) accessible directly via in-game Settings.
- **Steamworks Bypassed:** Native iOS C stubs (`steam_stub.c`) replace `steam_api64.dll`, allowing offline play without DRM crashes.
- **Sentry Disabled:** Crash telemetry disabled to avoid unnecessary overhead and background network calls.
- **iOS Sandbox & File Sharing:** `UIFileSharingEnabled` and `LSSupportsOpeningDocumentsInPlace` are enabled. You can manage your saves and mods directly through the **Files** app on iOS (`On My iPhone -> Slay the Spire 2`).

## Step 1: Create a Private GitHub Repository

1. Go to [GitHub.com](https://github.com/new) and create a **Private** repository (e.g. `sts2-ios-port`).
   > ⚠️ **Important:** Ensure the repository is **Private** to protect your game assemblies and personal configuration.

2. In PowerShell, initialize git and push to your new repository:
   ```powershell
   cd c:\Users\User\Documents\ANTI\STS2port
   git init
   git add .
   git commit -m "Initial commit of STS2 iOS port"
   git branch -M main
   git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/sts2-ios-port.git
   git push -u origin main
   ```

## Step 2: Supply Matched Game Data and the Mobile Texture Cache

Use `SlayTheSpire2.pck`, `sts2.dll`, `Sentry.dll`, and `Sentry.Godot.dll` from the same game installation. The build verifies the three managed assemblies, and the app verifies the PCK size plus the cache manifest before launch.

Build the required ASTC 8×8 cache with the Godot 4.5.2 Mono console executable:

```powershell
Godot_v4.5.2-stable_mono_win64_console.exe --headless --path godot --script scripts/build_mobile_texture_pack.gd -- "C:\path\to\SlayTheSpire2.pck" "C:\path\to\SlayTheSpire2-Mobile.pck"
```

Then copy both files to the app through iTunes/Finder File Sharing or the iOS Files app:

- `SlayTheSpire2.pck`
- `SlayTheSpire2-Mobile.pck`

The mobile cache is mandatory. The port intentionally refuses to fall back to desktop BPTC/DXT textures because iOS would expand them to RGBA8 and can terminate the app for excessive memory use.

### Option A: Via the iOS Files App / iTunes (Recommended)
1. Push the repository as-is without uploading the 1.9 GB PCK to GitHub.
2. The GitHub Action will build the runner `.ipa`.
3. Sideload the `.ipa` using AltStore.
4. On your iPhone, open the **Files** app $\rightarrow$ **On My iPhone** $\rightarrow$ **Slay the Spire 2**.
5. Copy both matched PCK files into that folder.
6. Launch the game!

### Option B: Bundle the Desktop Game PCK
1. Before pushing to GitHub, run our PCK splitter script:
   ```powershell
   python scripts\split_pck.py
   ```
   This splits `SlayTheSpire2.pck` into 90 MB chunks inside `pck_parts/` (under GitHub's 100 MB per-file limit).
2. Commit and push the parts:
   ```powershell
   git add pck_parts
   git commit -m "Add split game assets"
   git push
   ```
3. GitHub Actions will reassemble the desktop PCK during the build. The generated `SlayTheSpire2-Mobile.pck` must still be copied through File Sharing unless you also extend the private workflow to bundle it.

## Step 3: Download the IPA from GitHub Actions

1. In your GitHub repository, click on the **Actions** tab.
2. Select the latest run of the **Build iOS IPA** workflow.
3. Once finished, scroll down to the **Artifacts** section at the bottom.
4. Download the newest `SlayTheSpire2-iOS-ipa-<run>.zip` and extract the `SlayTheSpire2-iOS-memfix-<commit>.ipa` inside it.

---

## Step 4: Sideload via AltStore

1. Send `SlayTheSpire2-iOS.ipa` to your iPhone (via AirDrop, iCloud Drive, or cable).
2. Open **AltStore** on your iPhone.
3. Tap the **My Apps** tab $\rightarrow$ tap the **$+$** button in the top-left corner.
4. Select `SlayTheSpire2-iOS.ipa`.
5. AltStore will sign the app with your Apple ID and install it to your home screen!
